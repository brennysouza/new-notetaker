# NEW-NOTETAKER

## Description
This application is a simple note taker that allows users to enter their errands, meetings, and assignments to be done. Users have an option to enter a title, and some text to help elaborate what they need to get done. They are able to save not only onto the sidebar of the application, but all data entered is saved onto local database. These can also be deleted if needed.

## Installation
This is a back end application that users must access by entering in the assigned local port.

## Usage
The following is a video that demonstrates the functionality of the SVG logo maker and all tests passing.
